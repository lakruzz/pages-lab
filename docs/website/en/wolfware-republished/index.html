          <h1>WolfWare - 2016 Republish Preface</h1>

          <p class="cuff">WolfWare and the bloody but, yet edifying, tale about The Bonnie Situation and why Mr. Wolf surely must be a role model for every consultant is now republished after 7 years off line.</p>

<p>The concept of WolfWare is one I came up with back in 2005. At that time I was working as a self-employed consultant, and I had more work requests than I could handle myself. I felt that it was time to organize and consolidate into a company and WolfWare was my first shot at it. It was meant to be a collaboration of really skilled people. So good that people would take pleasure in seeing them work.</p>

<p>Part of the WolfWare concept was a retelling of the bloody but edifying tale of <em>The Bonnie Situation</em>, one of the side-stories in Tarantino’s movie <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, and an interpretation of the story that reveals why Mr. Wolf is a role model for al consultants.</p>

<p>Recently I found the story from way back then at the <a href="http://www.waybackmachine.org" target="waybackmachine">WayBackMachine</a> and I’m republishing it here at these pages because it’s still highly relevant - and edifying.</p>

<p>The original story has several parts:</p>

<p><a href="/wolfware/intro/welcome" class="wolf-item">The Introduction</a>
<a href="/wolfware/intro/bonnie" class="wolf-item">The retelling of <em>The Bonnie Situation</em></a>
<a href="/wolfware/intro/interpretation" class="wolf-item">The interpretation</a>
<a href="/wolfware/concept/revelation" class="wolf-item">The revelation of the WolfWare concept</a>
<a href="/wolfware/pack/thepack" class="wolf-item">An invitation to join <em>The Pack</em> of Mr. Wolves</a></p>

<h2 id="looking-back-at-what-actually-happened">Looking back at what actually happened</h2>

<p>Today when I write this, just a few days before the New Year 2016. <a href="http://www.Praqma.com" target="praqma">Praqma</a>, of which I’m one of the original founders, is a reality. We started in 2007 and 6-7 years later we made it through the financial crises, it looked like we we’re going to make it after a relative slow start.</p>

<p>Up until the beginning of 2015; honestly we we struggling to kick-start or start-up. But then came 2015.</p>

<p>In less than 12 months we have grown from 8 to 21 people, we have grown out of our old <em>PraqmaPlex</em> office and we now have 5 offices in total, including one in each of the three Scandinavian capitals.</p>

<p>I’m happy and proud to say that in reality WolfWare manifested itself in the sum of all that we’ve done: <a href="http://www.praqma.com" target="praqma">Praqma</a>, the <a href="http://www.code-conf.com" target="code">CoDe conferences</a>, <a href="http://www.josra.org" target="josra">Josra</a>.</p>

<p>Today we call the Wolves CoDe’ers (Continuous Delivereres) but it’s basically the same thing, and we’re still <a href="http://www.praqma.com/jobs" target="praqma">hiring</a> and we’re still expanding into new countries and even new businesses.</p>
